# Here's my weather app!

Displays the current weather, as well as a 7-day forecast.
I tried to make it as dynamic as possible including the date, day of the week, and icons. 
I also implemented the OpenWeather API to get the data for each city
There's also an email input and social media icons as a placeholder that you could easily activate if desired (are currently inactive)
Feel free to check it out and see what you think!
